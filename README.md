# Scoutbook Buddy

> Scoutbook Buddy - a Scoutbook enhancing Chrome extension

Scoutbook Buddy is not endorsed by the [Boy Scouts of America](https://www.scouting.org/). I'm just a dad with a child in the program.

Scoutbook Buddy is a [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) extension to add features to 
[scoutbook.com](https://www.scoutbook.com/). 
This project was created to demonstrate my ability to [learn how extensions work](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) and my Javascript prowess.

My desire to start this project came from the use of 
[Feature Assistant Extension for Scoutbook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/feature-assistant-extensi/paemmmaolgojladlndlbpgjpmflfcjoa), 
another extension for scoutbook. I knew it provided tools to help the user, but didn't realize how _
much_ it added. I once complained about a feature being 
broken on the site only to learn later that it was actually provided by the 
extension and not the site. I'm _very_ gracious for the work Gary did on that extension.

I am working one that extension too, but wanted to publish this since I
put so much work into it and so I can develop parts that don't fit into that 
project's "ecosystem".
